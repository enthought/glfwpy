Supported Platforms:
1. Windows
2. OSX
3. Linux
4. FreeBSD coming soon

Requirements:

1. Python: http://www.python.org
2. GLFW: http://www.glfw.org/
3. PyOpenGL from trunk: http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/
4. Cython: http://www.cython.org

Documentation:
1. Please refer to the glfw docs at http://www.glfw.org for glfw documentation
2. Please refer to examples folder for examples showing use of the api

Caveats:
The following part of the glfw api are not wrapped
1. Imaging functions (Users are expected to use a python imaging library to load textures)
2. Threading functions (Users are expected to use the python threading library)
3. glfwGetProcAddress

Convention:
This is almost a 1:1 wrapping of the glfw api. The glfw prefix has been dropped from function calls and constants in the Python versions.
